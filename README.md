# Browser Update Notifier
Receive a notification if the browser is no longer supported

Usecase: For several websites we needed a notifier that said the browser was outdated. Because we don't want to invent the wheel again we looked at some code which was used before which works fine. 
https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/browserupdnotify/ is an outdated extension which had was no longer maintained since 2010 I deciced to make a new extension for this with the browser-update.org script.

## Installation
Install the extension using composer
```
composer require dmg/browserupdatenotifier
```
